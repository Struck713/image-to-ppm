# image-to-ppm

[PPM](https://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html) is like the WAV file of images. It's just raw pixel data. So I wrote this Rust program to make images worse by converting them to PPM. At this point, it can only do PNG but at some point I will *probably* implement more image formats.
