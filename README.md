# image-to-ppm

[PPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm) is like the [WAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV) file of images. It's just raw pixel data. 
So I wrote this Rust program to make images worse by converting them to PPM.

Currently, this program can convert JPG and PNG images to PPM.

To use it simply run: `image-to-ppm <input file> <output file>`

There's not much more to it.
